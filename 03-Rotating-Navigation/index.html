            <h1>Jeong Kwan, The Philosopher Chef</h1>
            <small>Netflix Series: The Chef's Table</small>
            <p>
                Jeong Kwan is one of the best chefs in the world. This would be notable by any metric—the best in the
                world!—but is all the more notable because Jeong Kwan is a Buddhist nun who lives in the Chunjinam
                hermitage in the mountains of South Korea. If you want to taste her temple food—it is hard to
                overestimate the degree to which you should try to make this happen—you’ll have to head east, to Seoul,
                and then 169 miles south, to the hermitage, where she cooks for her fellow nuns and for the guests who
                have been coming more frequently now that the secret of her culinary genius is out.
                As a Seon Buddhist, she lives on a strictly vegan diet, excluding certain varieties of Allium, and no
                animal products. She quickly shot into the global limelight when she was featured on an episode of the
                Netflix series Chef’s Table in 2017.
                In keeping with her Buddhist philosophy, Jeong Kwan makes every effort to work with nature. From her
                gardening practices (which we would consider far beyond the status of organic) to her cooking and
                fermenting. Everything is grown seasonally and treated as such that it celebrates the ingredient for
                what it is.
